Q.1 An obvious countermeasure against this attack is to validate the input
    (and potentially output) point; this is in fact a *required* step in
    most standards.  Explain how this validation procedure works.
Q.2 If the protocol for interaction had used point compression, this could
    act as a countermeasure against the attack.  Explain what this concept
    means, and why the claimed countermeasure could be effective.
Q.3 As with most side-channel attacks, fewer interactions with the target
    device is preferable.  Present a formal argument (i.e., one not based
    on experimental evidence alone) that explains how many interactions you
    expect to make in this attack.
Q.4 Imagine that the target device uses a key refreshing mechanism, st.  k
    will be different for each interaction.  Providing some experimental
    evidence where appropriate, assess the  a) theoretical (i.e., by using
    standard cryptanalysis, irrespective of the context), and b) effective
    (i.e., as used concretely in this context)  security levels of the EC-
    DLP associated with this curve.

If the device was used in the Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), an 
attack may still be feasible. In ECDH, Alice selects a private key 
d_A ∈ [1, n – 1] where n is the size of E(𝔽_p) where 𝔽_p is the field 
the curve is defined over, and a public key Q_A = d_A × G, where G is 
the generator. Bob also selects a private key d_B ∈ [1, n – 1] and a 
public key Q_B = d_B × G. Alice then computes 
d_A × Q_B = d_A × d_B × G = (x_k, y_k). Bob also computes 
d_B × Q_A = d_B × d_A × G = (x_k, y_k). The shared secret is x_k. 
If an attacker implemented a man-in-the-middle attack, since the 
device performs no point validation, an attacker could intercept Alice’s
public key Q_A, and Bob’s public key Q_B, and forward the point at infinity
to both Alice and Bob. As a result of this, Alice and Bob would both
compute d_A × 𝓞 = 𝓞 and d_B × 𝓞 = 𝓞. Therefore, the secret key x_k 
would be 0. The attacker could therefore recover the secret key with 
probability 1.
